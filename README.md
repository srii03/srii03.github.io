ðŸš€ From Classroom to Cloud: My Journey to Cloud-Native Mastery & Leadership
Imagine a student hunched over a laptop, coding her first app, dreaming of systems that power the world. That was me, Srilakshmi Nair, a year ago. Now, Iâ€™m a passionate developer and leader, building cloud-native solutions, mastering DevOps, and steering agile teams. My journey is a story of containers, microservices, and impactâ€”each project a chapter thatâ€™s shaped me. Letâ€™s dive in!

Chapter 1: Conquering the Cloud with Kubernetes
Repository: sit737-2025-prac6p
My cloud adventure began with a Node.js app deployed via Docker and Kubernetes. Writing Dockerfiles and Kubernetes manifests felt like unlocking a superpower. Using kubectl to scale pods and manage services, I learned the art of container orchestration. This project sparked my love for scalable cloud systems.

Chapter 6: Orchestrating Microservices with Docker
Repository: sri-sit722-part3
I developed two Python microservicesâ€”book_catalog and inventory_managementâ€”each with a Dockerfile. Using Docker Compose, I made them work in harmony. This project was my masterclass in microservice architecture.
Skills Gained: Microservices, Docker, Docker Compose, Scalability

Chapter 7: Solo Mission with an AI Emergency Assistant
Repository: emergency-ai-assistant
My proudest feat was a full-stack AI emergency assistant built with JavaScript. From designing a custom UI to integrating AI prompts for crisis response, I owned every step. This capstone proved I could deliver solo with creativity and grit.
Skills Gained: Full-Stack Development, JavaScript, AI, Independence

Chapter 8: Leading IoT Innovation
Repository: emergency-assistantOrganization: DataBytes Organisation
As Scrum Leader, Web Lead, and Liaison for an IoT project, I led my team to a High Distinction. I built React dashboards for real-time sensor data, ran sprint planning, and bridged stakeholders. This project blended technical prowess with agile leadership.
Skills Gained: IoT, React, Agile, Scrum, Leadership

Chapter 9: Driving DiscountMate as Product Owner
Role: Team LeaderStatus: Internal Repository
Leading DiscountMate, a smart e-commerce platform, I owned the product backlog and sprint planning in Trello while coding frontend features. Guiding my team taught me to turn vision into reality through agile practices.
Skills Gained: Agile Leadership, Trello, Frontend, Team Coordination

Chapter 10: Automating with Jenkins
Repositories: my-jenkins-pipeline, jenkins, Jenkinss
I built CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins, scripting in Groovy and integrating with GitHub. Watching commits trigger seamless deployments felt like magic. This project cemented my DevOps passion.
Skills Gained: Jenkins, CI/CD, Groovy, Automation

Chapter 11: Innovating with a Bartering System
Repository: household-bartering-system
I created a Node.js platform for cashless bartering, promoting sustainable community trading. This project merged backend development with a vision for social good.
Skills Gained: Node.js, Express, Sustainable Tech

Chapter 12: Polishing My Toolkit
Repositories: 

sit725-t1-practical-dock: Docker practice
SIT725-T1-P3: RESTful API with Node.js
chapter-8-example-3: Microservices study
SIT725-T1-P1: UI design with HTML/CSS

These projects honed my skills in Docker, APIs, microservices, and UI design, building a versatile developer toolkit.
Skills Gained: Docker, REST APIs, Microservices, UI/UX
